# HeartDisease
Project Overview 
This is a heart disease data set, the main purpose of the data set is to analyse the number of people getting heart disease. The main objective is to analyse which gender and what age group have heart disease. 
The use of pandas in a Jupyter Notebook and manual exploratory data analysis are covered in this project. 
This project covers manual exploratory data analysis and using pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
